# SingleLinkage
The output of this program is designed to mimic SciPy's [scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.linkage.html).  The code is written to read in data from the Pokemon.csv file and cluster the first 20 Pokemon together, but it is easily adapted to deal with arbitrary datasets.
